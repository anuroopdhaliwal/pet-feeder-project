## Part 3: Reflection
For Part 3, I chose to use Copilot to help enhance my flowchart logic and help write a professional README file to implement into my GitHub repository. 

When prompting Copilot to assist with my flowchart, I attached my own flowchart and asked it to enhance the logic and produce a new visual flowchart. The enhanced logic it produced was identical to the logic already in my flowchart, which confirmed my logic was correct; however, it did provide insight into potential enhancements which could be made including timestamps for each step, retry limits to prevent infinite alert loops, a log of all actions, and a fallback in the case of sensor or scale failure. The suggested enhancements raised concerns about system reliability and fault management, which I had not thought about. I adopted the log of all actions as a proposed improvement to the design. Despite providing useful suggestions, the visual diagram it produced contained numerous mistakes such as misspells and no ending.

For the fourth option, I asked Copilot to help write a professional GitHub README.md file for my assignment, which I added as an attachment to provide more context. Copilot provided a fully formatted README file which included an overview of the project, the features and design of the system, the variables and logic flow, test scenarios, future improvements and a how to use section. I used the feedback provided to enhance and improve my original README file by adding further ideas and making it more professional.

Using Copilot during this assignment highlighted the ability to use AI to suggest improvements and improve clarity, however, when using AI to create diagrams, I encountered numerous errors. As a result, AI is useful when used as a tool to enhance but it requires human judgement in order to identify and correct potential mistakes.

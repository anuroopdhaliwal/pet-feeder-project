## Part 3: Reflection
For Part 3, I chose to use Copilot to help enhance my flowchart logic and help me write a professional README file to implement into my GitHub repository. 

When prompting Copilot to assist with my flowchart, I attached my own flowchart and asked it to enhance the logic and produce a new visual flowchart. The enhanced logic it produced was identical to the logic already in my flowchart; however, it did provide insight into potential additions which could be made including timestamps for each step, including retry limits to prevent infinite alert loops, a log of all actions, and a fallback in the case of sensor or scale failure. I used the additions of a log of all actions as a proposed improvement to the design. Additionally, the visual diagram it produced contained numerous mistakes such as misspells and no ending.

For the fourth option, I asked Copilot to help write a professional GitHub README.md file for my assignment, which I added as an attachment to provide more context. Copilot provided a fully formatted README file which included an overview of the project, the features and design of the system, the variables and logic flow, test scenarios, future improvements and a how to use section. I used the feedback provided to enhance and improve my README file by adding further ideas, ultimately influencing my final solution.

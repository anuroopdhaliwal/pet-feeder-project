## Intro to Information Technology Pet-Feeder Assignment 1
The project is a design of an automated and programmable pet-feeder which dispenses pet food for cats and dogs at scheduled times. The pet feeder monitors whether the food is dispensed at scheduled times and if it is consumed by the pet, sending alerts to the user accordingly. 

## Features
- Scheduled feeding times input by the user
- Automatically dispenses the food at the scheduled times
- Detects if the food is consumed within a set feeding period
- Alerts the user when either the food is not dispensed properly or is not consumed on time by the pet
- Updates the user when the feeding is successful

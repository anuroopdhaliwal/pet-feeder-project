## Intro to Information Technology Pet-Feeder Assignment 1
The project is a design of an automated and programmable pet-feeder which dispenses pet food for cats and dogs at scheduled times. The pet feeder monitors whether the food is dispensed at scheduled times and if it is consumed by the pet, sending alerts to the user accordingly. The feeder is designed for a single pet and requires weekly input since it has limited memory.

## Features
- Scheduled feeding times input by the user for up to three times per day
- Automatically dispenses the food at the scheduled times
- Sends user alerts for unconsumed food or improper dispensing of food
- Sends user updates when the feeding is successful
- Powered by a continuous outlet source

## Constants
- Thirty minute feeding period
- 150 grams of food per feeding time

## Future improvements
- Send detailed alerts with the specific amount of food consumed
- Implement a sensor in the food storage bin to allow for refill alerts
- Allow users to input the amount of food to be dispensed
